# Here are my reflections on the TypeScript information modules I've learned:

1. ### Module №1 - Getting Started with TypeScript:

      **This module improved my understanding of TypeScript by explaining why TypeScript is superior to JavaScript for web development, and I learned how to install TypeScript and customize it in my Visual Studio Code project. I learned what type hints are and what other features TypeScript has to offer. By discussing all the above concepts, it can be said that they are fundamental and very relevant in my development work**   
      **The acquired knowledge can be applied in every real task where TypeScript is used, by installing and customizing TypeScript in your project and understanding what are its differences and advantages over JavaScript. Example  where these skills could be beneficial: We wanted to move our project to TypeScript**

# Here are my reflections on the TypeScript information modules I've learned:

1. ### Module №1 - Getting Started with TypeScript:

      This module improved my understanding of TypeScript by explaining why TypeScript is superior to JavaScript for web development, and I learned how to install TypeScript and customize it in my Visual Studio Code project. I learned what type hints are and what other features TypeScript has to offer. By discussing all the above concepts, it can be said that they are fundamental and very relevant in my development work.   
      The acquired knowledge can be applied in every real task where TypeScript is used, by installing and customizing TypeScript in your project and understanding what are its differences and advantages over JavaScript. Example  where these skills could be beneficial: we wanted to move our project to TypeScript.

2. ### Module №2 - Declare Variable Types in TypeScript:
      This module improved my understanding of TypeScript by explaining the benefits of declaring typed variables in TypeScript. I also learned how to: declare variables using primitive types; declare variables using object types; and declare variables using union and intersection types. This module also explains what types and subtypes are in TypeScript and how to work with them. The concepts of declaring typed variables are very useful, they help to detect bugs related to the type of variables before running the code, these concepts are very relevant in my development work.   
      This knowledge is the basis of typescript, it is applicable in all real projects where it is used, by assigning a certain type to variables, for early error detection. Example  where these skills could be beneficial: we needed to explicitly specify the type of a certain variable.

3. ### Module №3 - Implement Interfaces in TypeScript:
      This module improved my understanding of TypeScript by explaining the reasons for using an interface in TypeScript, learning how to declare and create an interface instance, how to extend an interface, and how to declare interfaces with custom array types. I also learned how an interface differs from a type alias and how to describe a JavaScript API using an interface. Interface concepts are very useful and convenient, they help to define what the code contract requires, these concepts are very relevant in my development work.   
      This knowledge is applicable to most real-world projects using TypeScript, by specifying code contracts for certain forms of data. Example  where these skills could be beneficial: we needed describe an object, naming and parameterizing the object's types.
